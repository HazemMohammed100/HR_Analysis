Data Description:

• A training institute that conducts training for analytics/ data science wants to
expand their business to manpower recruitment (data science only) as well.
The company gets a large number of signups for their training. Now, the company wants to
connect these enrollees with their clients who are looking to hire employees
working in the same domain. Before that, it is important to know which of these
candidates are really looking for new employment. They have student
information related to demographics, education, experience, and features related
to training as well. They have student information related to demographics,
education, experience, and features related to training as well.

• To understand the factors that lead a person to look for a job change the agency
wants you to design a model that uses the current credentials/demographics/
experience to predict the probability of an enrollee to look for a new job.

# Conclusion
1. I have used the univariate charts to explore the data in each column and get a
a clear understanding of the data.

2. Bivariate charts to explore the relation between two features and
see how each feature could affect the target.

3. Multivariate swarm plot to explore the relationship between the
number of trainees classified by their education level and the number of training
hours they have completed in training.

4. I have created three models to try to reach the best accuracy of the predicting
whether the future will apply to look for new employment or not.

5. The three models were created due to the ambiguity I faced of how to deal with
the so many null values.

6. I used the SMOTE algorithm to overcome the imbalance of the data.
